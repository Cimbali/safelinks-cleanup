# Safelinks Cleanup

[![Thunderbird add-on version][addon_version_badge]![Thunderbird add-on rating][addon_rating_badge]][addon_page]

In case the Advanced Outlook.com security for Microsoft 365 subscribers is turned on, many links are changed to be in the form of https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https.... instead of the original link.

This add-on undos that process so that the original link is instead used in the message.
It decodes the rewritten URL and inserts the original URL instead.
